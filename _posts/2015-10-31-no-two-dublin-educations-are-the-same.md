# No two Dublin educations are the same.

**We couple the power of a classic college preparatory education with the ability and flexibility to dive deeper into a newly discovered passion.**

We require **rigorous and extensive course work **in English, Mathematics, Science, History, a World Language, Technology and the Arts. But this is just the foundation. The excitement for our students is in being able to **take their ideas and passions further.**

For some that is in investing themselves heavily in AP Course work in the Sciences or Humanities. For others it is maximizing self-expression through both the Visual and Performing Arts. Others delve deeply into Technology and Robotics. They are fully supported through student requested electives, independent studies and a capstone Senior Project that offers students the opportunity to engage in a **year-long rigorous study **centered-around a question or topic that is of special interest to them.

**But what if I don't have an academic passion right now?**

We don't expect you to.**We would rather see you be open to the possibilities than to have it all figured out.**Nothing is more empowering to us as educators than when a student discovers that they really are passionate about something unexpected. At Dublin, that happens more times than not.

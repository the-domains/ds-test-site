# We don't pay lip service to the Arts.

Did you know that researchers have discovered **that artists have increased neural matter in areas relating to fine motor movements and visual imagery?**Who wouldn't want that? Involvement in the arts is also associated with gains in math, reading, cognitive ability, critical thinking, and verbal skill.

**High school students who take arts classes have higher math and verbal SAT scores**than students who take no arts classes and they tend to increase linearly: the more arts classes, the higher the scores. Young people who participate regularly in the arts are four times more likely to be recognized for academic achievement, to participate in a math and science fair or to win an award for writing an essay or poem than students who do not participate.

**At Dublin we believe the arts are an essential part of a well-rounded education.**Beyond the qualities of creativity, self-expression, and communication, art is a type of work. This is what art has been from the beginning. Through art, we learn the meaning of the joy of work - work done to the best of one's ability, for its own sake, and for the satisfaction of a job well done.

**You cannot touch art without touching values:**values about home and family, work and play, the individual and society, nature and the environment, war and peace, beauty and ugliness, violence and love. The great art of the past and the present deals with these durable human concerns. When we study art of different cultures, we expose ourselves to the expression of a wide range of human values and concerns. We sensitize ourselves to values that shape all human efforts.
